        <p align="justify">Potatoes are in many countries one of the most common and simple foods. Have you ever
          wondered how important potatoes really are in our diet?
          There are thousands of potato varieties cultivated everywhere around the world, representing 300 million
          metric tons of crops, or in other words the third most important food crop in the world (Potato Facts and
          Figures, CIP International Potato Center). We can therefore consider potato crops as a major element for food
          security. Potato is an essential food source: for instance, from 1845 to 1852, a massive destruction
          of potato crops, from which the Irish population was relying on, caused a big famine, also called “The Irish
          Potato Famine”. It was responsible for the death of a million people and the flee of two million people.
          Ireland's global population decreased by one third (Gillissen, 2015). <br/>

          In Switzerland, the blackleg disease is the <b>first cause of removal of the market</b> of potato lots (Rouffiange
          et al. , 2014), by causing the loss of tens of hectares of crops. Climate change is exacerbating this issue:
          the effects of increased greenhouse gasses concentrations, now more than ever, are being felt. 2021 is the
          7th consecutive year (2015-2021) where global temperature has been over one celsius degree above pre-industrial temperature
          (according to the World meteorological organization). <br/>
    
          In Europe for that matter, “the major effects reported on Climate Change are reduced water availability and
          a shorter suitable winter time slot for potato production” (Haverkort, A.J., Verhagen, 2008). Since there
          will be longer heat waves and humidity, pathogens might also be more and more present (Romero et al, 2021).
          <br/>
    
          Both insects and pests are the main explanation for crop damage and yield loss. Right now, the easiest way
          to limit crop damage is by using pesticides: it is the most widely used form of crop protection. However,
          these products are worsening environmental and human health problems. Among them, we can note a particularly
          huge decline of insects, including pollinators. Non negligible amounts of greenhouse gasses are emitted
          during pesticide manufacturing: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (Heimpel GE, Yang Y, Hill JD,
          Ragsdale DW 2013). For example, phosphate mining for pesticide production causes major damages to the
          ecosystems and pollutes the environment (Wozniacka G. 2019). <br/>
    
          Moreover, the rising heat of water due to climate change worsens pesticides damages on aquatic life (Folmar,
          LC, Sanders HO, Julin AM. 1979). Indeed, the rate of animal and plant extinction tends to accelerate:
          there’s more and more imbalances in natural systems creating larger outbreaks of pests and weeds. According
          to soil scientists, regarding the current soil destruction, <b>human health will be seriously endangered</b> within
          50 years. Food crops might also provide less and we will not have enough fertile arable land to feed
          ourselves (Thiel T, Drossel B. 2018). Human health is at risk as long as pesticide use and climate change
          coexist. Pesticides, even in small quantities can cause diverse health issues and diseases (Lau WKM, Kim KM.
          2021). It becomes quite clear that we need to develop more sustainable solutions: here you can find a link to our <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/insa-lyon1/sustainable">sustainable
