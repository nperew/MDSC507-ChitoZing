          <b><u>Importance of Outreach:</u></b><br><br>
          A critical part of project development is consulting with 
          and receiving feedback from experts and professionals in the 
          subject area of the proposed project. 
          It gives us the opportunity to gain insight into the strengths 
          and shortcomings of our project design, scientific feasibility 
          and the impact our project will have in the community.<br><br> 

          <b><u>Contacts:</u></b><br><br>
          To get a better understanding of our project and identify 
          areas of improvement, we reached out to a wide range of 
          professions including professors, dermatologists, physicians, 
          nurses and patients.<br>

          <u>Dr. Laurie Parsons</u> is a dermatologist and the medical director 
          at the Sheldon Chumir Wound Care Clinic and works alongside 
          Alberta Health Services. She also conducts research in the 
          Department of Cumming School of Medicine at the University of 
          Calgary. We reached out to Dr. Parsons to ask about the 
          feasibility of our project and how we could address allergic 
          reactions to chitosan.<br>

          Our conversation with Dr. Parsons yielded several 
          key considerations. First, she encouraged us to consider the 
          cost associated with using chitosan. She mentioned that in the 
          past, chitosan was used to suspend epidermal cells which were 
          used as a grafting material. They saw positive results, 
          chitosan aiding in the shift of chronic wounds to acute wounds. 
          However, the production of chitosan-based products soon became 
          too expensive and was discontinued by the Alberta Health Services. Dermagraft costs around $900 USD, $600 USD per becaplermin gel tube and $600 USD for allograft. Her story put a lot of emphasis on the importance of finding a cheaper alternative when creating our product.‚Äù
          <br>
          Secondly, she informed us that the only way to 
          effectively address allergic reactions to chitosan was 
          through patch testing as it is often really difficult to be
          predictive about allergies. Her experience working with 
          chitosan, derived from shellfish, did not show any significant 
          allergic reactions in patients and minimal reactions in
          patients allergic to seafood. She suggested we build on the 
          work of others by finding sufficient data that show minimal 
          allergic reactions to chitosan in patients and put an allergy 
          warning on the package for disclosure.<br><br>

          <u>Dr. Keeyoung Kim</u> is an associate professor in the 
          department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, 
          Schulich School of Engineering. We spoke to Dr. Kim about 
          various topics, including crosslinking, hydrogels, bioprinting 
          and scaling-up of projects.<br>

        ChitoZing, being interested in creating a hydrogel 
        wound dressing, sought advice from Dr. Kim with research 
        experience in infections, inflammation and chronic diseases. 
        Similar to Dr. Parsons, Dr. Kim commented on the importance of 
        minimizing costs. He suggested using gelatin, a cheap, easy to 
        handle/storage biopolymer to make hydrogels. A drawback to this 
        however, would be the loss of antimicrobial properties provided 
        by chitosan. Regardless, his suggestion was valuable as it opened 
        up a different route ChitoZing could take with the project.<br>

      Dr. Kim also mentioned a key benefit of creating a hydrogel
      instead of leaving our co-polymerized chitosan and 6-gingerol 
      product in powder form. He confirmed that durability is significantly
      increased when topical agents are made into hydrogels, 
      taking us a step closer to achieving a low-maintenance topical agent.

      Lastly, Dr. Kim gave insight into important considerations 
      when working to scale-up hydrogels products. Producing a patch 
      often requires more time and equipment to produce, cut and package, 
      thus a liquid or powder form is ideal for scaling-up. This sparked 
      the idea of creating a user-friendly kit that includes the chitosan 
      6-gingerol powder and an aqueous mix-in solution as our final product.
      <br><br>
      <u>Dr. Elmar J. Prenner</u> is a professor in the department of Biochemistry,
      Faculty of Science, with broad research interests in biomembrane 
      architecture (lipid rafts, domains), lipid-protein interactions, 
      nanoparticle based pulmonary drug delivery; bioinorganic chemistry 
      (membrane interactions of heavy metals); bioanalytical chemistry 
      (bioassay development), biophysical techniques. <br>
      Discussing the project with Dr. Prenner and his masters student, 
      <u>Travis Issler</u>, we were able to confirm the advantages and 
      disadvantages of using synthetic biology to promote chitosan 
      crosslinking with 6-gingerol and synthesis.<br>

      A large part of confirming our protocol included the assessment of 
      alternative strategies to genuinely develop a project that relied 
      heavily on synthetic biology as opposed to other methods. 
      We discussed their protocol, which includes using crosslinking 
      reagents such as glutaraldehyde to develop the crosslinked chitosan 
      which is purified in hydrogel form.
      <br><br>

      Upon further contextualization and input from<u> Dr. Omid Haji-Ghassemi</u>, 
      a professor in the department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 
      and a structural biologist, we deduced that most cross-linking agents, 
      such as glutaraldehyde, would prove too toxic to use in the synthesis 
      of medical equipment. They offered insight in the linker process 
      that would help us avoid using excess chemicals and reagents to create
       a product that would use as few materials as possible. 
       Dr. Haji-Ghassemi also noted that external cross-linking was 
       a highly random process, oftentimes introducing unequal dispersion 
       of the cross-linked molecules, which would contribute to the 
       toxicity of the 6-gingerol if exposed in high concentrations.
       <br><br>

     <u> The Rotary Flames House</u> is a palliative care centre for 
      children and a facility that first introduced one of our group 
      members to open MRSA wounds, which is where the idea for this 
      project came to fruition. As we continued to evolve and expand 
      the project, we checked regularly with the palliative care nurses, 
      inquiring about ease of application, the best texture to work with,
       clean-up, and other aspects of open wound care.<br><br>

       <u>Sydney Potter</u> is an occupational therapy master‚Äôs student in 
       her final year. Occupational Therapists (OT) work with patients to help get them back to 
       doing routine, everyday tasks. OTs offer a unique perspective on what patients may struggle with, 
       and have an intimate knowledge of their needs. Our conversation with Sydney brought up an important 
       issue in wound care - wound management. Chronic wounds, especially pressure sores, require repositioning 
       every 2-4 hours. However that is an unrealistic workload for either nurses or OTs to manage and in the chaos 
       of their day to day patients are not repositioned as often as they should be. Her suggestion was to provide some 
       indication that a dressing needs to be adjusted, which is something no other bandage offers and would help serve 
       as a reminder for caregivers working with patients.<br><br>

          <h4><b><u><centre>Conclusion</centre></u></b></h4> 
          <p>We concluded over time that a <b>powder form</b>, which could be
            easily mixed into a soluble paste that hardens in a short period 
            of time, <b>would be the ideal product for storage.</b> 
            Because of the busy nature of such care centres, and home-care, 
            as well, we also concluded that<b> having the product come in the 
            form of a kit, with pre-measured containers and solution, would 
            make it accessible and easy to use</b>. The idea of<b> colour-changing 
            materials came into play when we were discussing the periodic 
            change of the wound packing, as well as the ease with which it 
            could be removed.</b><br>
     
           We were also told that a big part of wound dressings is the 
           take-off process, especially when it comes to young patients. 
           After some literature review, we concluded that <b>6-gingerol, 
           which is a polar substance, would help to solubilize the 
           chitosan in water, granting easy removal by washing away 
           the wound packing. </b>The concepts surrounding reusing the packing
            are still evolving.</p>
